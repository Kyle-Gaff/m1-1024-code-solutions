## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- Will AI replace software developers?
  Likely not, but coders who use AI will replace those who don't.
- What is the best way to use AI tools when learning software development?
  AI is useful for small repeated functions. Having AI write code for you would not be wise.
  AI can also be used to answer code questions, or quiz you.
- What is the danger of using AI tools for software development while I'm still learning?
  It could be tempting to use AI to find bugs in your code. This could cause one to become reliant on AI to find bugs
  rather than being able to find them yourself.
