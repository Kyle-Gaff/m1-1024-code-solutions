## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

  Variables are meant to store data

  use const let or var and then type in the name of the variable and the value you want to assign to it
- How do you initialize (**assign a value to**) a variable?
  use the = symbol then write the value after it
- What characters are allowed in variable names?
  letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs are all viable options but cannot start with a digit. It's also
  customary to start with a lower case letter.
- What does it mean to say that variable names are "case sensitive"?
  if you type in 'variableName' as 'VariableName' it won't work. (capitalization matters)

  to store an integer or floating point number

  the = operator assigns value
- How do you update the value of a variable?
  write the variable name = and what you want the value to change to
- What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?
  null can be assigned, undefined means you left an area blank
- Why is it a good habit to include "labels" when you log values to the browser console?
  labels help you remember what a value is supposed to represent
- Give five examples of JavaScript primitives.
  1 (number) 'this is text' (string) true (boolean) false (boolean) 'this is also text'(string)
  not sure if that's what the question was asking.
