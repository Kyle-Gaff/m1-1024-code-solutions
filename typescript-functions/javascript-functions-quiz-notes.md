  functions are objects that perform tasks or calculate values
- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  function keyword begins the creation of the function, name/identifier is optional, parameters (is what it sounds like), { to indicate the start of the function's code block, optional return statement (returns a value)

  allows the function to return a value
